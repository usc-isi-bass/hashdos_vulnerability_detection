A project to detect and mitigate hash-collision denial-of-service vulnerabilities automatically, in binary code.

# Setup

## Build docker
Build the docker container with these commands.
<br>
`cd ./docker_scripts`
<br>
`bash docker_build_pypy3.sh` (or `bash docker_build_cpython3.sh`)

## Run docker
`bash docker_run_pypy3.sh` (or `bash docker_run_cpython3.sh`)

## Inside the docker container:
The hash function patching analysis can be run with:
<br>
`python3 ./binalyzer_drivers/hash_func_patching_driver.py --help`
<br>
This will produce a results file named `results_*` (or as specified by the user).
